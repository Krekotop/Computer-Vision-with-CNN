# Computer-Vision-with-CNN

There are two .py files - one,named CNN is a model itself. 
You don't need to run it, you just can take a look at it if you want. 
To make predictions, put the images into the folder 'contest', and run the code of 'predict_model.py'.It will produce images with titles predicted by model.
Take a note that empty directory is not allowed on github, so I added one image into 'contest'. Delete it before inserting your images.
